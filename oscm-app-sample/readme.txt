Sample implementation of a service controller based on the
Application Provisioning Platform (APP).

The sample shows how the methods of a service controller could
be implemented using the automatic polling mechanisms of APP.
For this purpose, the service controller does not require a real 
application. It just manages the instance status by means of 
a dispatcher and sends information emails.

For details, refer to the documentation in the source code.
