The billing adapter implements the billing interface of CT-MG. 
It adapts the external billing system model and interfaces to the ones of CT-MG.

The file billing adapter works with a file-based mock billing application which is a 
REST web application. The REST endpoints must be configured in the file 
billingApplication.properties.
