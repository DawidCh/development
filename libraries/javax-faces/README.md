Java Library: Mojarra JavaServer Faces
Vendor:       Oracle
Version:      2.1.29 

**IMPORTANT**

When upgrading MOJARA implemenention, please remember that it should be done
in following way:

 * Optionally delete old *javax.faces.jar*
 * Put a jar file with updated version but keep the same file name

File name is fixed in installation scripts and used as such to minimize any possible
issues coming from the fact that file name would differ. However it is unlikely to happen,
better stay on the fixed file name.
